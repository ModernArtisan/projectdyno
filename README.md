# Project Dyno

Project Dyno is a JavaScript framework for creating in-product learning experiences for web applications.  Project Dyno utilizes UI overlays known as coach marks.  A coach mark gives the user information about a UI element.  A series of coach marks can be used to create a tour.  Tours can be used to teach users about product workflows, features, and best practices.

There are two components to Project Dyno.  The first is the Project Dyno Client.  The second is the Project Dyno Authoring Experience.

## Client

The Project Dyno Client is a JavaScript API.  It is used by a web application and is responsible for running a tour.

## Authoring Experience

The Project Dyno Authoring Experience is a desktop application built on Electron.  It is a tool that is used to author a tour.  Use of this tool is not required.  But it does make it easier for non-engineers to create and manage tours.
